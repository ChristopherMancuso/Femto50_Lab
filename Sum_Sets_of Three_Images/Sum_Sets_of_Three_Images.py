'''

This program assumes you do three grating positions and for each grating position there are three separate files to be summed together.
Must be careful of the naming. If over 100 scans need to order like Scan001, Scan010 and Scan100 for python to read files in the correct order.
The files to be summed over need to be placed in the data folder and the final summed images will be in the summed_images folder.
